## 消费者获得代币

> #### Tokens Earned by Consumers

---

===

> The amount of tokens earned by the user is reliant on their contribution coefficient and the number of referrals they've made successfully. All users who consume media on Current from any of our content integrations will be awarded platform tokens.

### 同步媒体网络和参数设定

> #### Syncing Media Networks and Preferences

===

> A user’s ‘mine rate’ is impacted by the amount of data that is tied to their account. They can increase this rate by syncing third-party profiles. This incentive increases user inputs and allows the recommendation algorithm to provide more personalized content. As the Current network grows, more value is created and a more robust recommendation platform with exponentially greater content integrations will emerge for users.

### 邀请他人加入Current

> #### Inviting Other Users to Current

===

> A user may invite others to Current and earn up to \(3%\) of their distribution value of tokens each new user earns in perpetuity. Current may implement a split of the 3% where both the referrer and the referee each get a \(1.5%\) share of the tokens the new user earns.

===

> Example: Tom joined Current on his own. Tom Invites Steve and then Steve invites Jerry.

===

> Tom = 55% of his TR \(Token reward\) + 1.5% of Steve's TR

===

> Steve = 55% of his TR + 1.5% bonus of his own TR + 1.5% of Jerry’s TR

===

> Jerry = 55% of his TR + 1.5% bonus of his own TR

### 广告阈值设置与挖矿速度

> #### Ad threshold and Faster Mining

===

> New users will be shown ads until they have 5 tokens in their wallet \(or the equivalent of the lifetime value of a free user within Current\). Ads will reappear if the user’s balance drops below this threshold. Users do not need to trade in tokens to eliminate ads post-threshold. If a user chooses to keep ads activated, this will positively affect their con-tribution coefficient, effectively allowing them to mine tokens faster.
