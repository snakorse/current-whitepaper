## 消费者获得代币

> #### Tokens Earned by Consumers

---

用户所获得的代币数量取决于他们的贡献系数和他们成功完成的推荐数量。所有在我们的内容集成中使用媒体的用户都将被授予平台代币。

> The amount of tokens earned by the user is reliant on their contribution coefficient and the number of referrals they've made successfully. All users who consume media on Current from any of our content integrations will be awarded platform tokens.

### 同步媒体网络和参数设定

> #### Syncing Media Networks and Preferences

用户的“挖矿速率”会受到与他们账户绑定的数据量的影响。他们可以通过同步第三方配置文件来提高这一速率。这种激励增加了用户输入，并有助于推荐算法提供更个性化的内容。随着Current网络的发展，更多的价值被创造出来，一个更健壮的以指数级的扩大内容集成的用户推荐平台将会形成。

> A user’s ‘mine rate’ is impacted by the amount of data that is tied to their account. They can increase this rate by syncing third-party profiles. This incentive increases user inputs and allows the recommendation algorithm to provide more personalized content. As the Current network grows, more value is created and a more robust recommendation platform with exponentially greater content integrations will emerge for users.

### 邀请他人加入Current

> #### Inviting Other Users to Current

一个用户可以邀请其他人到Current，并赚取高达\(3%\)他们每个新用户永久获得的代币的发行价值。Current可能会实现3%的分拆，在这个比例中，推荐者和被推荐者都可以分享新用户所获得的代币1.5%的份额。

> A user may invite others to Current and earn up to \(3%\) of their distribution value of tokens each new user earns in perpetuity. Current may implement a split of the 3% where both the referrer and the referee each get a \(1.5%\) share of the tokens the new user earns.

举例：汤姆自己也加入了Current。汤姆邀请史蒂夫，然后史蒂夫邀请杰瑞。

汤姆 = 他自己所有TR\(代币奖励\)的55% + 史蒂夫TR的1.5%

史蒂夫 = 他自己所有TR的55% + 他所有的TR的分红的1.5% + 杰瑞TR的1.5%

杰瑞=他自己所有TR的55% + 他所有的TR的分红的1.5%

> Example: Tom joined Current on his own. Tom Invites Steve and then Steve invites Jerry.
>
> Tom = 55% of his TR \(Token reward\) + 1.5% of Steve's TR
>
> Steve = 55% of his TR + 1.5% bonus of his own TR + 1.5% of Jerry’s TR
>
> Jerry = 55% of his TR + 1.5% bonus of his own TR

### 广告阈值设置与挖矿速度

> #### Ad threshold and Faster Mining

新用户将会被展示广告，直到他们的钱包里有5个代币（或者相当于一个免费用户的生命周期值）。如果用户的余额低于这个阈值，广告就会重新出现。用户不需要使用令牌进行交易，以消除阈值后的广告。如果用户选择保持广告激活，这将对他们的贡献系数产生积极影响，从而使他们能够更快地挖掘代币。

> New users will be shown ads until they have 5 tokens in their wallet \(or the equivalent of the lifetime value of a free user within Current\). Ads will reappear if the user’s balance drops below this threshold. Users do not need to trade in tokens to eliminate ads post-threshold. If a user chooses to keep ads activated, this will positively affect their contribution coefficient, effectively allowing them to mine tokens faster.
