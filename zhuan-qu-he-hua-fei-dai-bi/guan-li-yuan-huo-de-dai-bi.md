> #### Tokens Earned by Curators

---

===

> Within Current, users are able and encouraged to curate multiple media streams into Channels. These channels act as “folders” of content from multiple media networks. Current will reward users who curate popular channels within the network by measuring the amount of time spent on their curated media.

===

> The curators get a 20% share of tokens based on the consumption of their channels and playlists. Since consumption is the primary method of measurement for their reward, the contribution coefficient of the users that the curators curate for determines how many tokens the curator will earn per session.
