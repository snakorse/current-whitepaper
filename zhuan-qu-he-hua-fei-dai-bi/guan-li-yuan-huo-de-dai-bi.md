## 管理员获得代币

> #### Tokens Earned by Curators

---

在Current内，用户可以并被鼓励将多个媒体流管理到频道中。这些通道相当于来自多个媒体网络的内容的“文件夹”。Current将通过计算用户在他们所管理的媒体上所花费的时间，来奖励那些在Current网络上发布频道的用户。

> Within Current, users are able and encouraged to curate multiple media streams into Channels. These channels act as “folders” of content from multiple media networks. Current will reward users who curate popular channels within the network by measuring the amount of time spent on their curated media.

策展人根据他们的频道和播放列表的播放情况可以获得20%的代币份额。由于消费是衡量其报酬的主要方式，所以策展人的贡献系数决定了策展人每次会获得多少代币。

> The curators get a 20% share of tokens based on the consumption of their channels and playlists. Since consumption is the primary method of measurement for their reward, the contribution coefficient of the users that the curators curate for determines how many tokens the curator will earn per session.
