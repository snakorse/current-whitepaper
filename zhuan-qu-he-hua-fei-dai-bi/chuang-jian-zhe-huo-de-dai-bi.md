## 创建者获得代币

> #### Tokens Earned by Creators

---

目前，Current平台通过一系列的内容集成提供内容。总之，这些集成为Current用户提供了前所未有的媒体类别。在2019年初，Current将允许直接将内容上传至其网络，并将以分散的方式发布内容。

> At present, the Current platform provides content through a series of content integrations. Together, these integrations provide Current users with an unprecedented catalog of media. In early 2019, Current will allow for the direct upload of content to its network and will distribute that content in a decentralized manner.

为了从战略上把创作者带到平台上，Current将把每个赚取的代币的20%分配给媒体的创造者，而不管媒体项目的源网络是什么。所有的收入都是在第三方保管，直到创作者加入网络并认领他们的钱包。

> To strategically bring creators onto the platform, Current will be allocating 20% of each earned token to the creators of the media consumed within Current regardless of the media item’s source network. All earnings are held in escrow until the creator joins the network and claims their wallet.

一个第三方托管账户是在一个创建者累积了36,000秒（10小时）的流媒体之后创建的，在那之前，与这些较小的创造者相关的令牌将会流向增长池。如果创作者在12个月内没有认领他们的钱包，那么就会有10%的月衰减率。这个时间限制促使创建者们更快地加入，同时也保护平台不让太多的代币退出流通。所有的衰减代币最终都将通过增长池返回令代币池。

> An escrow account is created once a creator has accumulated 36,000 seconds \(10 hours\) of streaming, until then the tokens associated with these smaller creators will go towards the growth pool. If creators do not claim their wallets within 12 months, a 10% monthly decay rate is imposed. This time limit motivates creators to join sooner and also safeguards the platform from having too many tokens out of circulation. All decayed tokens will ultimately go back to the token pool via the growth pool.

一旦进入Current，创作者将继续把他们的内容上传到他们的平台（Spotify、Youtube、Soundcloud等），然后用户就可以通过Current平台来消费这些内容。创作者将从集成平台（如Spotify或Youtube）获得他们通常的许可费，此外还将从Current的收入中获得20%的收入分配。随着该平台进一步整合去中心化存储，创作者可以在代币支付时获得全部收入。

> Once on Current, creators will continue to upload their content to their platform\(s\) of choice \(Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.\) and a user would then consume that content via the Current platform. The creator will get paid their usual license fees from the integrated platform \(ex. Spotify or Youtube\) in addition to getting a 20% allocation of the earned tokens from Current. As the platform further integrates decentralized storage, Creators can earn 100% of their revenue when paid in tokens.

有了这些机制，用户可以更好地支持他们喜爱的创作者，通过消费当前的产品，帮助他们为自己的工作赚更多的钱。
