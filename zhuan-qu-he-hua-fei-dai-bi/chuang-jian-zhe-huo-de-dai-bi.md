> #### Tokens Earned by Creators

---

===

> At present, the Current platform provides content through a series of content integrations. Together, these integrations provide Current users with an unprecedented catalog of media. In early 2019, Current will allow for the direct upload of content to its net-work and will distribute that content in a decentralized manner.

===

> To strategically bring creators onto the platform, Current will be allocating 20% of each earned token to the creators of the media consumed within Current regardless of the media item’s source network. All earnings are held in escrow until the creator joins the network and claims their wallet.

===

> An escrow account is created once a creator has accumulated 36,000 seconds \(10 hours\) of streaming, until then the tokens associated with these smaller creators will go towards the growth pool. If creators do not claim their wallets within 12 months, a 10% monthly decay rate is imposed. This time limit motivates creators to join sooner and also safeguards the platform from having too many tokens out of circulation. All decayed tokens will ultimately go back to the token pool via the growth pool.

===

> Once on Current, creators will continue to upload their content to their platform\(s\) of choice \(Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.\) and a user would then consume that content via the Current platform. The creator will get paid their usual license fees from the integrated platform \(ex. Spotify or Youtube\) in addition to getting a 20% allocation of the earned tokens from Current. As the platform further integrates decentralized storage, Creators can earn 100% of their revenue when paid in tokens.

===

> With these mechanisms, users can better support their favorite creators by consuming on Current and helping them earn more for their work.
