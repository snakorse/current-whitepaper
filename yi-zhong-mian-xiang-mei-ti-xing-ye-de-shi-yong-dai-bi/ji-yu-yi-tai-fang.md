> Tokens will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. With incremental advancements, one of the largest developer communities, and top-tier backing the Ethereum blockchain has become the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smart contracts. The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum network \(i.e., wallets, dev tools, and exchanges.\) Although limitations in transaction speed exist, leveraging off-chain payment channel networks such as Raiden address these bottlenecks. Advancements such as these allow platforms to track microtransactions down to the second.

> Current only measures consumption on multimedia networks. As of now Current does not plan on measuring contribution on platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. Alternate initializers will be considered in the future. Once the initializer is verified, the contribution is attributed to the appropriate participants \(see page 13 - Token Value Flow\).
