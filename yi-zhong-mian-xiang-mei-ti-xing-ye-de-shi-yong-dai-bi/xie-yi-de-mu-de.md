## 协议的目的

> #### Purpose of the Protocol

---

该协议的主要目标是基于市场的接纳程度而发展，因此将逐步推出。该协议的初始功能是，以三个步骤奖励消费周期的参与者:（1）验证初始化；（2）计算应为对网络的价值；（3）计算分配给贡献者的适当的标记奖励。

> The primary objective of the protocol is to evolve based on market adoption, and therefore will be rolled out incrementally. The initial function of the protocol is to reward participants of the consumption cycle in three steps: \(1\) verify the initializer; \(2\) calculate the value of the action to the network, and \(3\) calculate the appropriate token reward to distribute to the contributors. At the outset, Current will have a main initializer that is triggered by the consumption of more than 30 seconds of play \(consumption is also referred as “mining” within the Current whitepaper\).
