> #### Purpose of the Protocol

---

===

> The primary objective of the protocol is to evolve based on market adoption, and therefore will be rolled out incrementally. The initial function of the protocol is to reward participants of the consumption cycle in three steps: \(1\) verify the initializer; \(2\) calculate the value of the action to the network, and \(3\) calculate the appropriate token reward to distribute to the contributors. At the outset, Current will have a main initializer that is triggered by the consumption of more than 30 seconds of play \(consumption is also referred as “mining” within the Current whitepaper\).
