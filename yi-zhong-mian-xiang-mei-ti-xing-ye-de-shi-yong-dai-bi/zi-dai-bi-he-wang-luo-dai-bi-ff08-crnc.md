> Current will be integrating with the Bancor Protocol in order to provide liquidity and formulaically determine the price of sub tokens. The CRNC token mining pool will incentivize large media networks to use and implement the Current protocol by aligning incentives between host platforms, consumers, creators, and curators. This allows the protocol to achieve mass scale and more comprehensive datasets around user preferences and trends.
