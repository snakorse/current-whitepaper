### 基本的注意力代币（BAT）和Brave Browser

> #### Basic Attention Token \(BAT\) / Brave Internet Browser

===

> Brendan Eich, the founder of Javascript and co-creator of Mozilla, created the Basic Attention Token \(BAT\) to facilitate value exchange in the Brave Internet Browser’s digital advertising marketplace. Brave is an open-sourced, privacyfocused internet browser that blocks malvertising and ad-trackers while accurately rewarding publishers and advertisers through smart contracts on the blockchain. While capitalizing on the security and privacy conscious desktop internet user, they’ve also grown a modest user base of blockchain early adopters from the momentum of their successful ICO which raised $35M. Similar in the way that BAT commoditizes and rewards for “user attention” using web and publisher content, Current is directly applying to multimedia consumption.
