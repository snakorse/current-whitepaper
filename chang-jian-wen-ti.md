**为什么Current需要使用区块链来实现它的目标？**

> **Why does Current need to use the blockchain to accomplish its goals?**

Current将利用区块链的优势跨越两个阶段，首先，让Current用户能够记录用户对平台的贡献，并奖励他们的时间、注意力和消费。这将不断演变为使用区块链来帮助去中心化和透明地分发内容、支付、商品和服务。

> Current will utilize the benefits of a blockchain across two phases, first, enabling Current to record user contributions to the platform and reward them for their time, attention, and consumption. This will continually evolve towards using the blockchain to aid in the decentralization and transparent distribution of content, payments, goods and services.

**为什么Current选择以太坊而不是其他区块链？**

> **Why did Current choose Ethereum over another blockchain?**

之所以选择Ethereum网络，是因为它是为应用程序集成而构建的最健壮的区块链平台之一，同时它背后有着最大的开发社区。

> The Ethereum network was chosen because it is one of the most robust blockchain platform built for application integration along with the largest development community behind it.

Ethereum基金会致力于不断开发和改进底层技术，以改善规模问题，这使Ethereum成为最引人注目的区块链平台之一。我们的团队一直在密切关注Raiden的进展，以及我们如何利用状态通道来解决我们在Current内面临的可伸缩性问题。

> The Ethereum foundation's dedication to continually develop and improve the underlying technology to improve scaling issues make Ethereum one of the most compelling blockchain platforms to build on top of. Our team has closely been monitoring the progress of Raiden and how we can use state channels to solve the scalability issues we would be facing within Current.

**当前的平台是否仅仅依赖于第三方API集成？**

> **Is the Current platform reliant solely on third party API integrations?**

目前，Current平台在2017年3月底推出了一版本，其中包括8个公共和私人集成，其中很大一部分是通过直接合作实现的。我们所有的集成合作伙伴都从中受益，因为他们保留了用户在Current内播放产生的所有交互、数据和收入数据，例如，Spotify上的一个视频仍然可以在Spotify上播放，而且他们可以在Spotify上获得报酬。

> Current launched stage one of platform at the end of March 2017 with a mix of eight public and private integrations, a good portion of which we’ve secured through direct partnerships. All our integrated partners are benefited as they retain all the user interactions, data, and revenue from plays within Current, ie. a play on Spotify still counts for a play on Spotify and they get paid on that stream.

此外，由于Current应用的平均会话持续时间平均为18分钟，并且持续增加，这些集成可以期望用户在各自的网络上花费更长的时间，并为用户提供更好的体验。

> Also, with the average session duration in the Current app being an average of 18 minutes and continually increasing, these integrations can expect to see longer time spent on their respective networks and a better experience for their users.

我们的任务不是要蚕食我们的合作伙伴网络，事实上，我们希望我们的用户在这些网络中使用代币来获得高级订阅。这进一步使这些网络和整个行业受益，使免费用户成为付费用户。值得注意的是，我们的目标是随着时间的推移继续增加内容集成，进一步降低任何集成从Cuurent平台上移除可能带来的影响。

> Our mission is not to cannibalize our partner networks, in fact we want our users to use tokens for premium subscriptions within these networks. This further benefits these networks and the broad industry as a whole, turning free users into paying users. It is important to note, that our goal is to continue to add content integrations as time goes on, further decreasing the impact of any one integration dropping from the Current platform.

在平台的最后阶段，Current的平台将会达到用户的临界数量，它需要充分利用我们的去中心化媒体集成，与最受欢迎的第三方网络共存。

> During final phase of the platform, the Current platform will have reached the critical mass of users it needs to make full use of our decentralized media integration that would co-exist alongside the most popular third party networks.

**Current协议如何描述到平台的新集成？**

> **How does Current’s protocol account for new integrations into the platform?**

当添加新的集成时，特别是新媒体类型（例如电影），可用的相关信息池就会增长，从而增加我们的建议的广度。我们可以对更多内容进行分类和显示，从而使用户的参与度持续时间更长。这将反过来影响与每个用户和整个网络相关的贡献系数。

> When new integrations are added, especially of a new media type \(like film for instance\), the available pool of relevant information grows and therefore increases the breadth of our recommendations. We can catalogue and display more content and therefore keep users engaged longer. This will in turn impact the contribution coefficient associated with each user and the network as whole.

**CRNC令牌如何脱离Current平台？**

> **How are CRNC tokens leaving Current’s platform?**

通过代币购买或通过媒体消费而获得的代币券，将能够在参与的交易所公开交易他们的CRNC。

> Tokens purchased through the token sale or earned from their participation in the platform through media consumption will be able to openly trade their CRNC on participating exchanges.

**CRNC的总供给是多少？Current可能会发行更多吗？**

> **What is the total supply of CRNC? Will Current ever issue more?**

CRNC的总供应量将限制在10亿个代币，我们将永远不会在代币销售后再增发。在代币销售期间，所有的代币中有35%将用于购买，其余的将通过消费媒体的用户贡献来获得。用户能够获得这些代币的速度取决于代币动力学和协议部分中列出的各种因素。

> The total supply of CRNC will be limited at 1 billion tokens, and we will never issue new tokens after the token sale. During the token sale, 35% of all of the tokens will be available for purchase, and the remainder will be earned through a user's contribution by consuming media. The rate at which the user is able to earn these tokens is dependent on a variety of factors outlined in the Token Dynamics and Protocol section.

CRNC代币不会将用户的钱包留在生态系统中，直到他们被发送到支持的二级交易所的钱包里，或者被放在一个支持的或专用的离线钱包里。

> The CRNC tokens won’t leave a user's wallet on the ecosystem until they’ve been sent to a wallet on a participating secondary exchange, or are placed in a participating or proprietary offline wallet.

在未来，第二阶段之后，代币将可以直接在其他平台上使用，用于高级服务、内容和其他商品。也就是说，一旦Current的广告平台上线，这些外部服务就可以利用他们积累的CRNC来购买Curent平台上的展示位广告。

> In the future, beyond phase 2, tokens will be able to be spent directly on other platforms for premium services, content and other goods. That said, once the Current Ad Platform goes live, these external services can use their accumulated CRNC on targeting display advertising within the Current Platform.

**在Current平台上如何兑换CRNC代币？**

> **How are CRNC tokens redeemed in the platform?**

用户可以用CRNC订阅我们媒体合作伙伴（如Spotify）的高级服务。用户可以选择他们想要用CRNC兑换的服务，我们将提供一个升级他们在该网络上的服务的密钥。

> Users are able to redeem their CRNC for premium subscriptions to our media partners, such as Spotify. The user would select which service they would like to redeem their CRNC for and we would provide a key to upgrade their service on that network.

**你如何消除用户玩游戏或滥用系统来持续赚取代币的可能性？**

> **How do you remove any chances of users gaming or abusing the system to continually earn tokens?**

为了消除“坏参与者”的潜在欺诈行为，在代币动力学和协议部分的第10页中列出的8个变量组成了我们的贡献系数，设计了一种自动检测和调整参与者赚取代币的速率的方法。如果一个“坏行为者”被自动检测到，他们的贡献系数将变为零，即使有效地参与也将得到零个CRNC代币。

> To remove potential fraud from “bad actors” the 8 variables outlined on page 10 of the Token Dynamics and Protocol section that make up our contribution coefficient are designed in a way to automatically detect and adjust the rate at which the participant is earning CRNC tokens. Should a “bad actor” be automatically detected, their contribution coefficient will go to zero, effectively earning the participant zero CRNC tokens.

**在代币销售过程中会发行多少CRNC？**

> **How many CRNC will be issued during the Token Sale?**

在公开销售期间，将有350 000万CRNC代币或共代币供应量（1,000,000）的35%可用。

> 350,000,000 CRNC tokens or 35% of the total supply of tokens \(1,000,000,000\) will be available during the crowdsale.

**代币销售的最低限额是多少？**

> **What is the minimum cap goal for the Token Sale?**

5,000,000美元

> $5,000,000 USD

**代币销售的硬性上限是什么？**

> **What is the hard cap for the Token Sale?**

36,000,000美元

> $36,000,000

**谁能参与代币销售？**

> **Who can participate in the Token Sale?**

我们希望每个人都能参与我们的代币销售，有两种方式参与。

> We want everyone to be able to participate in our Token Sale and there are two ways to participate.
>
> 1. You can either obtain CRNC tokens by trading in other forms of cryptocurrency as part of the Token Sale \(Public Presale, and Main Sale\). Participants from the U . S . A . m u s t b e a c - credited to buy CRNC.
> 2. Alternatively, anyone can take part of the “Claim Your Wallet” campaign without spending anything. Users who claim their wallet will be given a predetermined amount of CRNC Tokens, distributed upon the launch of the CRNC attribution protocol.

**===**

> **What’s the minimum to participate in the Token Sale?**

===

> 0.03 ETH

**===**

> **Is there a distribution schedule on the tokens purchased during the presale?**

===

> In some cases, depending how big of a bonus on CRNC tokens you desire.

===

> In order to be eligible for large discounts on tokens purchased during the token sale you will be subject to a distribution period where you will be given tokens on a pro-rata basis depending on your selected distribution period.

**===**

> **What happens if we don’t meet our minimum cap goal?**

===

> All transactions will be refunded to the wallet address used in the transaction.

**===**

> **How do I set up my wallet on Current?**

===

> Once the CRNC wallets go live, interested parties will be directed to a portal where you will be asked to claim and generate your wallet. Once the wallet has been generated, you will be provided with a seed phrase tied to that specific wallet address. This is something you’ll keep for your records. Once that seed has been generated, you’ll be asked to enter a password. After this process has been completed, we will reward that address with a predetermined amount of CRNC tokens for doing so.

===

> With your new wallet generated, you’ll be able to make referrals to your friends to earn additional tokens.

**===**

> **Why is there a decay rate on CRNC tokens held in my wallet?**

===

> In order to incentivize active users on the platform, any CRNC tokens held in an account that goes inactive for more than 6 months will begin to decay; the decaying tokens will then be transferred back into the growth pool to reward active participants.

===

> A user will get a series of alerts before this takes place. The decay rate does not apply to any tokens purchased during the token sale, or tokens transferred out and held in an offline wallet.

===

> The rates of decay at associate intervals are as follows: 6 months @ 10% month-over-month
