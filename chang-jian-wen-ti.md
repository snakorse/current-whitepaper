---

**===**

> **Why does Current need to use the blockchain to accomplish its goals?**

===

> Current will utilize the benefits of a blockchain across two phases, first, enabling Current to record user contributions to the platform and reward them for their time, attention, and consumption. This will continually evolve towards using the blockchain to aid in the decentralization and transparent distribution of content, payments, goods and services.

**===**

> **Why did Current choose Ethereum over another blockchain?**

===

> The Ethereum network was chosen because it is one of the most robust blockchain platform built for application integration along with the largest development comm-unity behind it.

===

> The Ethereum foundation's dedication to continually develop and improve the underlying technology to improve scaling issues make Ethereum one of the most compelling blockchain platforms to build on top of. Our team has closely been monitoring the progress of Raiden and how we can use state channels to solve the scalability issues we would be facing within Current.

**===**

> **Is the Current platform reliant solely on third party API integrations?**

===

> Current launched stage one of platform at the end of March 2017 with a mix of eight public and private inte-grations, a good portion of which we’ve secured through direct partnerships. All our integrated partners are ben-efited as they retain all the user interactions, data, and revenue from plays within Current, ie. a play on Spotify still counts for a play on Spotify and they get paid on that stream.

===

> Also, with the average session duration in the Current app being an average of 18 minutes and continually increasing, these integrations can expect to see longer time spent on their respective networks and a better experience for their users.

===

> Our mission is not to cannibalize our partner networks, in fact we want our users to use tokens for premium subscriptions within these networks. This further benefits these networks and the broad industry as a whole, turning free users into paying users. It is important to note, that our goal is to continue to add content integrations as time goes on, further decreasing the impact of any one integration dropping from the Current platform.

===

> During final phase of the platform, the Current platform will have reached the critical mass of users it needs to make full use of our de-centralized media integration that would co-exist alongside the most popular third party networks.

**===**

> **How does Current’s protocol account for new integrations into the platform?**

===

> When new integrations are added, especially of a new media type \(like film for instance\), the available pool of relevant information grows and therefore increases the breadth of our recommendations. We can catalogue and display more content and therefore keep users engaged longer. This will in turn impact the contribution coefficient associated with each user and the network as whole.

**===**

> **How are CRNC tokens leaving Current’s platform?**

===

> Tokens purchased through the token sale or earned from their participation in the platform through media consumption will be able to openly trade their CRNC on participating exchanges.

**===**

> **What is the total supply of CRNC? Will Current ever issue more?**

===

> The total supply of CRNC will be limited at 1 billion tokens, and we will never issue new tokens after the token sale. During the token sale, 35% of all of the tokens will be available for purchase, and the remainder will be earned through a user's contribution by consuming media. The rate at which the user is able to earn these tokens is dependent on a variety of factors outlined in the Token Dynamics and Protocol section.

===

> The CRNC tokens won’t leave a user's wallet on the ecosystem until they’ve been sent to a wallet on a partici-pating secondary exchange, or are placed in a participating or proprietary offline wallet.

===

> In the future, beyond phase 2, tokens will be able to be spent directly on other platforms for premium services, content and other goods. That said, once the Current Ad Platform goes live, these external services can use their accumulated CRNC on targeting display advertising within the Current Platform.

**===**

> **How are CRNC tokens redeemed in the platform?**

===

> Users are able to redeem their CRNC for premium subscriptions to our media partners, such as Spotify. The user would select which service they would like to redeem their CRNC for and we would provide a key to upgrade their service on that network.

**===**

> **How do you remove any chances of users gaming or abusing the system to continually earn tokens?**

===

> To remove potential fraud from “bad actors” the 8 variables outlined on page 10 of the Token Dynamics and Protocol section that make up our contribution coefficient are designed in a way to automatically detect and adjust the rate at which the participant is earning CRNC tokens. Should a “bad actor” be automatically detected, their contribution coefficient will go to zero, e f f e c t i v e l y e a r n i n g t h e participant zero CRNC tokens.

**===**

> **How many CRNC will be issued during the Token Sale?**

===

> 350,000,000 CRNC tokens or 35% of the total supply of tokens \(1,000,000,000\) will be available during the crowdsale.

**===**

> **What is the minimum cap goal for the Token Sale?**

===

> $5,000,000 USD

**===**

> **What is the hard cap for the Token Sale?**

===

> $36,000,000

**===**

> **Who can participate in the Token Sale?**

===

> We want everyone to be able to participate in our Token Sale and there are two ways to participate.
>
> 1. You can either obtain CRNC tokens by trading in other forms of cryptocurrency as part of the Token Sale \(Public Presale, and Main Sale\). Participants from the U . S . A . m u s t b e a c - credited to buy CRNC.
> 2. Alternatively, anyone can take part of the “Claim Your Wallet” campaign without spending anything. Users who claim their wallet will be given a predetermined amount of CRNC Tokens, distributed upon the launch of the CRNC attribution protocol.

**===**

> **What’s the minimum to participate in the Token Sale?**

===

> 0.03 ETH

**===**

> **Is there a distribution schedule on the tokens purchased during the presale?**

===

> In some cases, depending how big of a bonus on CRNC tokens you desire.

===

> In order to be eligible for large discounts on tokens purchased during the token sale you will be subject to a distribution period where you will be given tokens on a pro-rata basis depending on your selected distribution period.

**===**

> **What happens if we don’t meet our minimum cap goal?**

===

> All transactions will be refunded to the wallet address used in the transaction.

**===**

> **How do I set up my wallet on Current?**

===

> Once the CRNC wallets go live, interested parties will be directed to a portal where you will be asked to claim and generate your wallet. Once the wallet has been generated, you will be provided with a seed phrase tied to that specific wallet address. This is something you’ll keep for your records. Once that seed has been generated, you’ll be asked to enter a password. After this process has been completed, we will reward that address with a predetermined amount of CRNC tokens for doing so.

===

> With your new wallet generated, you’ll be able to make referrals to your friends to earn additional tokens.

**===**

> **Why is there a decay rate on CRNC tokens held in my wallet?**

===

> In order to incentivize active users on the platform, any CRNC tokens held in an account that goes inactive for more than 6 months will begin to decay; the decaying tokens will then be transferred back into the growth pool to reward active participants.

===

> A user will get a series of alerts before this takes place. The decay rate does not apply to any tokens purchased during the token sale, or tokens transferred out and held in an offline wallet.

===

> The rates of decay at associate intervals are as follows: 6 months @ 10% month-over-month
