## CRNC钱包

> #### CRNC Wallet

---

Current将使用Ethereum MultiSig钱包作为我们的标准。CRNC将完全符合ERC20标准，以确保令牌与所有基于以太坊的钱包\(Mist、Geth、Metamask\)兼容。

> Current will use the Ethereum MultiSig wallet as our standard. CRNC will be fully compliant with ERC20 standards in order to ensure that the tokens are compatible with all Ethereum based wallets \(Mist, Geth, Metamask\).

===

> In the Current Media Platform, users have read-only access to the amount of tokens they’ve earned from their contributions. Within the platform, users will be supplied with an encrypted key that changes every 20 seconds. Users will then use this as one of their signatures as part of a two-factor authentication apart of the CRNC wallet that will be stored separately from the app itself. The wallet is being designed with anonymity and security in mind.

> While the user experience will be seamless, this encryption adds another layer of additional security, however, no matter how secure an online wallet or exchange is, possible security vulnerabilities inherently exist, e.g., human error. With the growth of Altcoins and token sales, we noticed very few options exist to store these coins offline. Current is exploring the possibility of providing the offline hardware needed for token holders who meet a predefined threshold for safer keeping.
