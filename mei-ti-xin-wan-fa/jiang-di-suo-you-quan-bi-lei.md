> One of the strongest attributes of CRNC is its accessibility and immediate impact to users. Most exchanges and crypto-enabled services require a lengthy registration process, some form of investment, or hardware for mining.

Ripple, Tezos, and many other blockchain protocols have very complex solutions that require a certain technical literacy and lack a broader relatability.

> With our hybrid approach, we’re able to garner broad adoption using our existing audience and their daily streaming media habits through a simple user experience and wallet integration, removing all technical complexities associated with the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Lastly, the other barrier to entry revolves around accountability. Many token sales are based on theoretical principles without any sort of product in market.
