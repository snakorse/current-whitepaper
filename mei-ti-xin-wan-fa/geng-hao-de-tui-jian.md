> #### Better Recommendations

---

一种算法可以将看似无限的内容库整合为可以让用户在短时间内理解并做出选择的几个选项。为了使任何给定的信息列表更易于管理，建议系统必须准确地模拟用户的偏好，揭示隐藏的偏好，避免冗余。

> An algorithm can consolidate a seemingly limitless content library into a subset of options that users can understand and make choices from in moments. In order to make any given list of information more manageable, a recommendation system must model users’ preferences accurately, uncover hidden preferences, and avoid redundancy.

Current专有推荐算法利用基于内容的过滤和协作过滤来确定媒体用户最感兴趣的内容。利用机器学习和神经网络，我们的算法会根据它所定义的关系信息来自动修正和改变。

> Current’s proprietary recommendation algorithm leverages both Content Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering to determine in what media users are most interested. Using machine learning and neural networks, our algorithm will self-amend and change incrementally based on the relational information it defines.

### 建立偏好配置

> #### Building a Preference Profile

===

> A preference in this circumstance is defined as a combination of inputs / actions that jointly indicate a greater enjoyment of one media item over another or others.

===

> Media items are defined by their metadata: artist name, album name, song length, beats per minute, genre type, mood type, era of origin and social data including likes, follows, comments, and shares and other qualities. Types of media are broadly represented by various audio and visual formats including music, video, podcasts, posts, articles, audio books, TV shows, movies and other media yet to be popularized.

===

> The Current system begins building an individual’s preference profile at the start of a user’s journey, after they select a genre from a predefined list. By finding other content with the same, or similar genre, the content filter provides an initial set of recommendations with varying degrees of strength. The system funnel further analyzes each media item to create a relationship between one another and make recommendations based on strong attributes like user plays, saves and skips.

===

> Over time and with the addition of profile information from third party integrations, the preference profile can become more robust than a similar model built on any single external network. As new types of media are added to Current and users interact with a more types of content, our preference profile will be in a unique position to identify commonalities between different types of media, such as, podcasts to videos, audiobooks and articles and so on.

### 专用的推荐算法

> #### Proprietary Recommendation Algorithm

===

> Our recommender system is based on two filtering methods: Content Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. While Content Based Filtering offers recommendations of new tracks similar to a user’s past consumption history, Collaborative Filtering offers recommendations to a user based on what other, similar users listened to.

===

> While Content Based Filtering uses features generated from textual metadata \(genre, category, keywords, embedded description words\), Collaborative Filtering calculates the correlation between the vectors which represent user consumption history.

===

> To improve efficiency with sparse data, the Current algorithm measures the cosine similarity between two vectors \(representing users or tracks\). Using a matrix of users and tracks the algorithm measures the magnitude of a user’s perceived value of the media through the vectors in a corresponding graph. We then analyze the cosine distance between two vectors to make recommendations:

===

> The user is the magnitude of a track play, where “i” and “j” are two users and this formula is applied to a specific track. The smaller the distance between two vectors, the higher the similarity between two tracks or users.

===

> To further improve our recommendation accuracy, Current will also employ features generated by convolutional neural net and autoencoder models in our Content Based Filtering algorithm.
