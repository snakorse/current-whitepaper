> #### User Growth Pool and Decay Rates

---

===

> The Current Growth Pool is always awarded 2% of every token mined within the system. This will ensure that the token reward pool never goes to zero and make future token releases unnecessary. In addition to this builtin distribution mechanism, the Growth Pool also receives token inflows from inactive accounts.

===

> A 10% monthly decay rate begins after 6 months of neglect, at which point tokens are directed back into the Current Growth Pool via the smart contract. This continues until the use of the Current Media Platform resumes \(a valid 30 second play or more\). Users will be notified of this when they join and repeatedly before the 6 month mark. Similarly, a 10% monthly decay rate will be imposed for creators who do not claim their escrow tokens within 12 months of being awarded them. This is done to ensure tokens are not lost within the platform by users who abandon. If a user decides to store his tokens on a third party or offline wallet no decay rate will be imposed.
