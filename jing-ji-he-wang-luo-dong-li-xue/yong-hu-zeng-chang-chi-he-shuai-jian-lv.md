## 用户增长池和衰减率

> #### User Growth Pool and Decay Rates

---

当前的增长池总是被授予系统中所挖掘的每一个代币的2%。这将确保代币奖励池永远不会变为零，并使未来的代币释放变得不必要。除了这个内置的分发机制之外，增长池还从不活跃的账户中接收到资金流入。

> The Current Growth Pool is always awarded 2% of every token mined within the system. This will ensure that the token reward pool never goes to zero and make future token releases unnecessary. In addition to this builtin distribution mechanism, the Growth Pool also receives token inflows from inactive accounts.

10%的月衰减率在6个月的忽视之后开始，在这一点上，通过智能合约，代币被引导回当前的增长池。这种情况一直持续到在Current媒体平台恢复使用（有效的30秒或更多）。当用户加入或在每次即将达到6个月之前，会收到通知。类似地，对于那些在被授予他们的12个月内没有申请代管代币的创作者，将会有10%的月衰减率。这样做是为了保证代币不会随着用户流失而丢失。如果用户决定将他的标记存储在第三方或离线钱包中，则不会产生衰减率。

> A 10% monthly decay rate begins after 6 months of neglect, at which point tokens are directed back into the Current Growth Pool via the smart contract. This continues until the use of the Current Media Platform resumes \(a valid 30 second play or more\). Users will be notified of this when they join and repeatedly before the 6 month mark. Similarly, a 10% monthly decay rate will be imposed for creators who do not claim their escrow tokens within 12 months of being awarded them. This is done to ensure tokens are not lost within the platform by users who abandon. If a user decides to store his tokens on a third party or offline wallet no decay rate will be imposed.
