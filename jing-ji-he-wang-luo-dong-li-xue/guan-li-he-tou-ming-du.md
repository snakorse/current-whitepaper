## 管理和透明度

> #### Governance and Transparency

---

如今，区块链公司在做代币销售时面临的最大问题是缺乏对公众的透明度。它将所有基于区块链的项目置于风险之中，因此Current将实施我们与许多令人惊讶的公司“默认为透明”的核心计划，在那里我们的社区提供了他们应该得到的信息。

> Today, the biggest issue facing blockchain companies doing token sales is the lack of transparency to the public. It puts all blockchain based projects at risk, thus Current will be implementing a core initiative we share with many amazing companies “Default To Transparency,” where our community is provided with the information they deserve.

===

> Starting in Q4 of 2018, we will send quarterly reports to all backers because we believe token sales should operate in a transparent manner. A lack of transparency can create a lack of trust. In addition, we felt it would be imperative to add additional governance mechanisms into the Current ecosystem that facilitates the growth of the platform alongside community supported development and greater good objectives.

===

> From the onset, Current will reserve 3% of the token pool for the creation of the Current Foundation. In the beginning, Current will serve on the Foundation's board of advisors. Over time, we will move towards the inclusion of key community members to aid in the oversight of the Current Foundation’s goals of long-term network governance, long-term support of token holder interests, transition to an open-sourced and decentralized platform, partner programs, greater good programs, and academic grants that include investments in technologies that benefit the ecosystem.

===

> As part of this process, Current will open source the protocols and several components of the media platform to the general public. This allows our community of developers to build and expand the network and, ultimately, the holders of Current tokens. This transition is a statement of our dedication to our community and encouraging an environment where all participants benefit from its success.
