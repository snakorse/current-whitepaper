## 代币稳定性和价值创造

> #### Token Stability and Value Creation

---

===

> Economics teaches us that value is subjective. Economic value for an item is created because people desire that item for one reason or another.

===

> As Bitcoin came into existence in 2009 and adoption spread, the value of the virtual currency skyrocketed. In 2016, Dutch economists Von Oordt and Bolt published a model to analyze virtual currency exchange rates and what factors led to value creation. They found that three components are important:

===

> 1.The existing use of virtual currency to make payments

===

> 2.Forward-looking investors buying the virtual currency; effectively regulating its supply

===

> 3.The factors that together will drive future consumer adoption and merchant acceptance of virtual currency.

===

> The basis of their theory came from economist Irving Fisher’s observation from 1911, that speculators may effectively limit the money supply by withdrawing money from circulation in anticipation of higher future utility.

===

> Limited issuance currencies such as Current’s digital tokens and Bitcoin fall into this category. When initially pricing the token sale and creating the foundational layer behind the network’s ecosystem, these factors were taken into consideration.

> #### Token Pool Dynamics

===

> * Limit the total supply of tokens to 1,000,000,000 \(1 Billion\) tokens
>
> * To eliminate the need for issuance of future tokens, we’ll create a user growth pool by taking a percentage of each token earned. The growth pool tokens gets put back into the miners reward pool after each block cycle

> * Reward users for their contribution while accounting for difficulty via contribution coefficient and block cycle variable as platform grows

> * Introduce a decay rate for long-time inactive users
>
> * Create a baseline market rate for the tokens via token sale and reward ecosystem
