## 一种动态的订阅模型

> #### A Dynamic Subscription Model

---

===

> The Current token creates a dynamic subscription model for streaming: one which, by allowing users the choice of toggling ads and subscribing to premium services, efficiently captures consumers’ willingness to pay for premium serv-ices against viewing ads.

===

> Evidence from the financials of two streaming services, Spotify and Pandora, show that consumers brings 30% - 40% higher revenue on a subscription over an advertising model \(see Appendix \#1 for a comparative analysis\). Yet the subscription segment across almost all services is smaller than that for free-tier users.

===

> In addition, the standard binary “advertising or subscription” model does not efficiently capture different consumer demand elasticities: especially those who value an ad-free experience, but do not necessarily consume enough to warrant a full-priced subscription.
