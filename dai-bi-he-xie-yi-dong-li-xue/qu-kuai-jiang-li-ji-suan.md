> #### Block Reward Calculation

---

===

> In order to ensure liquidity and supply, the Block Reward \(Br\) calculation maintains a ratio of available supply to demand. Each block is eq-ual to 3600 seconds or one hour of consumption \(mining\) done by a consumer. With every 100,000,000 blocks mined, the block reward changes in proportion with the number of tokens left in the system. This is known as a Block Cycle \(Bc\).
