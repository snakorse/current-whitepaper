## 区块奖励计算

> #### Block Reward Calculation

---

为了确保流动性和供给，区块回报（Br）计算维持了可用供应与需求的比率。每个块等于消费者3600秒或一个小时的消费（挖掘）。每挖100万个区块，区块的回报随系统中所剩的代币数量成比例变化。这就是所谓的区块周期（Bc）。

> In order to ensure liquidity and supply, the Block Reward \(Br\) calculation maintains a ratio of available supply to demand. Each block is equal to 3600 seconds or one hour of consumption \(mining\) done by a consumer. With every 100,000,000 blocks mined, the block reward changes in proportion with the number of tokens left in the system. This is known as a Block Cycle \(Bc\).

**变量**

Br = 区块奖励

Tp = Token Pool

To = Token’s Out \(During a single block cycle\)

Cp = Growth Pool \(During a single block cycle\)

Bc = Variable which increases as the number of block cycles increases,rate TBD where inflation &gt; 1,deflation &lt;1, Baseline =1

Total Token Supply: 1,000,000,000
