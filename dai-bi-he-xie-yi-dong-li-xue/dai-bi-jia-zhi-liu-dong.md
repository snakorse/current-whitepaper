> For consumers this is 55%, creators and curators this is 20%, for referrers this is up to 3%, and for the growth pool this is 2%. \*When content is consumed and a 3rd party curator is not present, Current is awarded the 20%. \*\*While a creator has less than 36,000 seconds \(10 total hours\) streamed on the platform their 20% share of tokens will be allocated to the growth pool until their escrow account is minimum is met. \*\*\*If a referrer is not present the 3% is awarded back to the growth pool. \*\*\*\*The growth pool will be allocated 2% of each token in all instances.
