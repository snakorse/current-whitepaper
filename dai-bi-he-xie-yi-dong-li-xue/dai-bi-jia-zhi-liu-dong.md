## 代币价值流动

> #### Token Value Flow

---

下图表示通过媒体消费挖掘的代币的基线分布结构。对于消费的某些媒体项目，分配可能会根据是否有推荐人或馆长而有所不同。

> The diagram below represents the baseline distribution structure of tokens mined through media consumption. For some media items consumed, the distribution may vary based on the presence or absence of a referrer or curator.

对于消费者55%；创作者和策展人20%，推荐者最多3%，增长池2%。当内容被消费，而不存在第三方策展人时，Current的奖励是20%。当一个创建者在平台上的时间少于36000秒\(10个小时\)时，他们20%的代币将分配给增长池，直到他们的托管帐户达到最小值为止。如果不存在推荐者，那这3%会奖励回给增长池。在所有实例中，增长池将分配每个代币的2%。

> For consumers this is 55%, creators and curators this is 20%, for referrers this is up to 3%, and for the growth pool this is 2%. \*When content is consumed and a 3rd party curator is not present, Current is awarded the 20%. \*\*While a creator has less than 36,000 seconds \(10 total hours\) streamed on the platform their 20% share of tokens will be allocated to the growth pool until their escrow account is minimum is met. \*\*\*If a referrer is not present the 3% is awarded back to the growth pool. \*\*\*\*The growth pool will be allocated 2% of each token in all instances.
