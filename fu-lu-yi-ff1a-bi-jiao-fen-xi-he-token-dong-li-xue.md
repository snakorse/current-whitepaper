### Spotify

> #### Spotify

===

> As Spotify isn’t publicly traded, we rely here on news reports of Spotify’s financials . reported to its Luxembourg parent.

===

> Spotify ended 2016 with 126 million monthly active users, with 78 million \(62%\) free-tier users and 48 million \(38%\) paid subscriptions. However, 89.9% of its revenue, 2.64bn Eur., is driven by paid subscriptions. Due to cost of revenues, the gross profit on premium subscriptions was €483.8m, while Spotify’s ad-supported business recorded a gross loss of €33.3m.

===

> We assume that cost of revenue is driven by streaming royalties to record labels, PROs, back-office services, and publishers, approximated on a per-play basis. We use a EURUSD conversion rate of 1:1.2.

===

> **Total Cost of Revenue**

===

> **Estimated Cost of Revenue per User per Year:**

===

> We assume the average play generates $0.006 in royalties \(industry eCPM\):

===

> **Number of plays per average user per year:**

===

> Assuming that consumer valuations for Spotify Premium are solely driven by the avoidance of ads \(aside from other benefits, for instance mobile app usage or higher audio quality\):

> **Number of plays per average user per year:**

===

> Thus we estimate that Spotify Premium users overvalue each stream around 35% as compared to free tier users

### Pandora

> #### Pandora

===

> Pandora, in contrast with streaming music providers like Spotify and Current, acts as an internet radio provider -- which means its royalty and distribution model is somewhat different, and we track listener time, rather than number of legitimate plays. These figures are quoted from its financial statements: the 2016 10-K and 2016 Q3 10-Q.

  
===

> Like Spotify, there are more Pandora subscribers than there are free-tier. There were 74.5M free-tier users, and 4.39M subscribers in 2016. Its subscription-based service logged 2.79B total listener hours, as compared to 19.17B on the free advertising tier.

===

> We use the RPM metric \(revenue per thousand listening-hours\) provided on the Pandora 10-K \(only the first nine months are included, because the RPM metric is abandoned after Q3 2016\):
