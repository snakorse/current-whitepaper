> During this phase, Current is solely sourcing content from third-party networks like YouTube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Internet Radio etc. ensuring adequate supply of media, to accelerate growth and meet user demand. At this stage, the goal was to find productmarket fit to establish a strong foundation for the product. With over 300 million songs and over 1 billion videos, over 200,000 people have used Current to listen, watch, and interact with media. The average user spends over 18 minutes per session and our Day 30 retention as of Q4 2017 is over 35% without any incentives built into the platform, well above industry standards at this stage.
