## Current生态系统的未来

> #### The Future Of The Current Ecosystem

---

===

> In collaboration with independent media platforms, the Current protocol will be forked to broaden the available market share and create sub-tokens for each media ecosystem. Each sub-token will have its own distribution rules and mechanics that are customized to the goals of the media platform. To avoid negative impacts on the Current ecosystem, the sub-tokens will have individual exchange rates related to the core network token and internal dynamics that are insulated by the inherent nature of the sub token. By creating a protocol and ecosystem for media platform tokens to exist, Current is able to take a larger stake in the streaming of content online, on any platform.

===

> As blockchain technology continues to mature and adapt to market needs, the token, the platform, and the protocol will continue to leverage bleeding edge technologies to maximize value for all participants. Three such strategies include:

### 区块链应用的高级身份配置文件

> #### A Superior Identity Profile For Blockchain Based Applications

===

> By aggregating the given identities of a user from several networks, Current is in a unique position to develop a robust preference and identity profile. This authentication layer allows any third party application to utilize the user’s identity attributes and associated data without taking ownership of it.

### 去中心化的存储基础设施和中心化的网络

> #### Decentralized Storage Infrastructure Alongside Centralized Networks

===

> The platform will provide decentralized media infrastructure to host content across millions of devices rather than on proprietary nodes. Fully decentralized media distribution requires significant and rapid industry acceptance.

===

> Without it, consumers are left with a limited content library. Current gradually leverages blockchain as the general public further adopts cryptocurrency and the media industry transitions to a more decentralized infrastructure. This approach allows the platform to gain momentum and reduce barriers to entry on both sides. Creators benefit from an established group of token holders within the network, and a significantly higher portion of revenue. The platform will leverage a protocol like IPFS or Storj as a directory for data storage and Ethereum smart contracts as the distribution logic.

### 基于State Channels实现规模化

> #### Ethereum Blockchain Scalability via State Channels For The Media Industry

===

> Using state channels, Current can build upon Raiden, specifically with the media industry in mind. Raiden’s launch has been delayed due to the fact it's aiming to build a universal solution that works in several different capacities. We believe we could add value to the industry by launching a media specific version any developer could build upon.
