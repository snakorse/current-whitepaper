## Current生态系统的未来

> #### The Future Of The Current Ecosystem

---

在与独立媒体平台的协作下，Current协议将被派生分支，以扩大现有市场份额，并为每个媒体生态系统创建子令牌。每个子代币都会有针对自己媒体平台所量身定制的分配规则和机制。为了避免对当前生态系统产生负面影响，子代币将具有与核心网络令牌和内部动态相关的独立汇率，这些汇率与子代币的固有特性相隔离。通过为媒体平台令牌创建一个协议和生态系统，Current可以在任何平台上对在线内容流进行更大的投资。

> In collaboration with independent media platforms, the Current protocol will be forked to broaden the available market share and create sub-tokens for each media ecosystem. Each sub-token will have its own distribution rules and mechanics that are customized to the goals of the media platform. To avoid negative impacts on the Current ecosystem, the sub-tokens will have individual exchange rates related to the core network token and internal dynamics that are insulated by the inherent nature of the sub token. By creating a protocol and ecosystem for media platform tokens to exist, Current is able to take a larger stake in the streaming of content online, on any platform.

随着区块链技术继续成熟和适应市场需求，我们的代币、平台和协议也将持续利用前沿技术，为所有参与者带来最大化价值。三个这样的策略包括：

> As blockchain technology continues to mature and adapt to market needs, the token, the platform, and the protocol will continue to leverage bleeding edge technologies to maximize value for all participants. Three such strategies include:

### 区块链应用的高级身份配置文件

> #### A Superior Identity Profile For Blockchain Based Applications

通过聚合来自多个网络的用户的给定身份，Current处于一个唯一的位置，可以开发一个健壮的首选项和身份配置文件。这个身份验证层允许任何第三方应用程序使用用户的身份属性和相关数据，而不需要对其拥有所有权。

> By aggregating the given identities of a user from several networks, Current is in a unique position to develop a robust preference and identity profile. This authentication layer allows any third party application to utilize the user’s identity attributes and associated data without taking ownership of it.

### 去中心化的存储基础设施和中心化的网络

> #### Decentralized Storage Infrastructure Alongside Centralized Networks

该平台将提供分散的媒体基础设施，以在数百万台设备上托管内容，而不是在专有节点上。完全的去中心化媒体需要广泛的行业认可。

> The platform will provide decentralized media infrastructure to host content across millions of devices rather than on proprietary nodes. Fully decentralized media distribution requires significant and rapid industry acceptance.

===

> Without it, consumers are left with a limited content library. Current gradually leverages blockchain as the general public further adopts cryptocurrency and the media industry transitions to a more decentralized infrastructure. This approach allows the platform to gain momentum and reduce barriers to entry on both sides. Creators benefit from an established group of token holders within the network, and a significantly higher portion of revenue. The platform will leverage a protocol like IPFS or Storj as a directory for data storage and Ethereum smart contracts as the distribution logic.

### 基于State Channels实现规模化

> #### Ethereum Blockchain Scalability via State Channels For The Media Industry

===

> Using state channels, Current can build upon Raiden, specifically with the media industry in mind. Raiden’s launch has been delayed due to the fact it's aiming to build a universal solution that works in several different capacities. We believe we could add value to the industry by launching a media specific version any developer could build upon.
