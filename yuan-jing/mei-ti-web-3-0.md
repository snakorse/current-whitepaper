> When we set out to build this ecosystem, we put you in mind: the everyday streamer. We considered the variety of media you stream and the various networks you have accounts on, and built an agile flexible platform that adapts to culture quickly. We didn't want you to make any sacrifices, so we integrated with the most popular networks. You want to control who your data is shared with and how it’s used, so we wrote win-win smart contracts that give you choices.
