据估计，Z一代的购买力为440亿美元，他们每天在手机上花费超过5个小时，这使得他们能够很好地接受加密货币的使用。通过设计我们的平台，使我们的平台拥有最数字化的活跃的一代，我们将自己与开发的基础设施协议区分开来，以服务于狂热用户的“初始浪潮”，并为区块链的世界提供有价值的新受众。

> With an estimated buying power of $44 Billion, Gen Z is spending more than 5 hours per day on their phone, making them well positioned for cryptocurrency adoption. By designing our platform with the most digitally active generation in mind, we differentiate ourselves from the infrastructural protocols developed to serve the “initial wave” of avid users and delivers a valuable new audience to the world of blockchain.

Armed with an acute awareness, and a strong interest and understanding of the digital landscape, these groups will represent the first generations who will be immersed in blockchain products and services. In many cases, Current will be the first digital wallet the mainstream public will own.
